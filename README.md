## Managing Roles and Restrictions

### Role-Based Access
The dashboard incorporates **Power BI Manage Roles** functionality to ensure secure and relevant access to data. 

#### Steps to Configure Roles:
1. Open the Power BI file in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Navigate to **Modeling** > **Manage Roles**.
3. Define roles based on business needs. Examples:
   - **Sales Manager**: Access to all employees' data.
   - **Sales Representative**: Access restricted to their own data.
4. Apply DAX filters for restrictions. Example for filtering employee-specific data:
   ```DAX
   [Employee Name] = USERNAME()
   ```
5. Publish the file to the Power BI Service and assign roles to users in **Security Settings**.

### Restrictions
- **Employee-Specific Data Access**: Users can only see their own performance metrics.
- **Channel and Source Filters**: Limit data visibility by communication channel and source.
- **Confidential Data Protection**: Sensitive fields such as revenue or client details are visible only to managers.
